My \bimatrixgame macro takes 8 parameters:
\bimatrixgame{#1}{#2}{#3}{#4}{#5}{#6}{#7}{#8}

where 

#1  dimension of the unitlength, typically 4mm,
    where each cell of the strategic form is 4x4
    units wide.  The top left corner of the grid
    has coordinates (0,0),  the cell to the right
    of it (top left) coordinates (4,0), the cell
    in the second row first column (0,-4)  and so
    on. This allows to use the \put command in
    the main parameter #6 if needed.

#2  number of rows

#3  number of columns

#4  name of row player

#5  name of column player

#6  list of strategy names for rows

#7  list of strategy names for columns

#8  list of payoff entries
each of which is either 

\payoffpairs{#1}{#2}{#3}

or

\singlepayoffs{#1}{#2}

where 

#1 row for payoffs

#2 list of row player payoffs in row #1

#3 list of column player payoffs in row #1

and each list is a list of items that can be any LaTeX 
expression, normally in {} unless it is a single digit
when the braces can be omitted.
Note that negative numbers have to be written as
{$-1$} (i.e. with $ $ so that the minus sign is long
and not just a dash when using  {-1}.

Example:

    \bimatrixgame{4mm}{2}{3}{I}{II}%
    {{T}{B}}%
    {{l}{c}{r}}
    {
    \payoffpairs{1}{012}{421}
    \payoffpairs{2}{301}{132}
    }

which, because it has single digits only, is best seen 
as displaying the payoff matrices to the two players next to
each other: 

for player 1,

    0 1 2
    3 0 1

and for player 2

    4 2 1
    1 3 2

ISSUES
------
for conversion from normal form to \bimatrixgame:

- format for specifying names for players and strategies
  defaults?  I, II for players
  T,B for two rows,  l,r  for two columns,  l,c,r  for three
  columns,   T,M,B for three rows,  a,b,c,d.... for more
  than 3 columns?

- surround all payoffs by {$ $} to get negative entries
  right (make sure to have a blank if no payoff, with $ $
  instead of $$ which creates LaTeX error

- fractions can first be displayed literally  like  $11/15$
  or parsed more intelligently, subject to the user wanting
  that option, as  $\frac{11}{15}$ ; see second Example with
  row payoff for cell (ZP, ad).

- conversion to .eps format (a few Unix lines from LaTeX
  file, I know how, the question is on which server).

- computation of best responses for row and column player and
  surrounding those payoffs with \fbox.

All this can be done nicely incrementally!
